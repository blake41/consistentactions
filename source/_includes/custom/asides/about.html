<h2>about me</h2>
<p>On a lifelong journey to become a master software developer.  I'm based in Brooklyn and have been in NYC since 2007 with the exception of a yearlong world trip in the middle of that stint.  I quit my job in May 2010 to teach myself Ruby on Rails and have been obsessed with programming ever since.</p>
