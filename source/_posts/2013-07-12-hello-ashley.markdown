Learning How To Teach

I've thought a lot about how people learn to program over the past two years.  As I was learning to program I kept having these revelations where I leveled up after finally understanding a concept.  Usually the lightbulb moment was a random event
but I couldn't shake the notion that there was a way this concept could have been explained to me months or years earlier
which would have allowed me to get to the lightbulb that much sooner.  I've tried to bring those experiences to The Flatiron School with the goal of figuring out a repeatable process of getting others to the lightbulb moment, without all the wasted time and frustration.  One thing I knew, but hadn't really internalized, was the idea that we all learn differently.  Adding Ashley to the team has brought a tremendous amount of experience and perspective to the Flatiron Faculty.  She introduced me to the idea that many students are visual learners, and I might be totally missing them by explaining things in the way they made sense to me.  Over the past week I've tried to integrate pictures, drawings, markers, colored pencils, and as many visual metaphors into my speaking as possible with tremendously positive results.  Variables are now "buckets or containers" and they have different colors.  Objects are big pieces of paper on a whiteboard.  I'd like to join the rest of the Flatiron School in welcoming a tremendous asset to our team.  Welcome Ashley!

So, how do YOU learn?
