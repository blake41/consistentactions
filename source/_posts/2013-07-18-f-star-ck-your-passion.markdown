Find your passion may be the worst most misguided advice I've come across in my short time on this planet.  Our parents generation was told to go to college, get a steady job and raise a family, stability was the route to happiness.  Our generation was the first one that expected more than just a steady job, we had to be immersed in wonder by our occupation.  This has left a generation feeling listless and unsatisfied with their current occupations.  The generation who was told going to an Ivy League college was the be all and end all.  Once they had that degree the world would open before them and they could pursue that which gave them supreme joy.  And yet most of them became bankers and consultants who despised their very existence.  Now they sit at their desks daydreaming about finding work that they are passionate about.  This begs the question, how do you find your passion?

One of the more life affirming ideas I've come across is the idea that it is NOT passion that brings hapiness.  I started reading a blog by Cal Newport called study hacks.  I was drawn to his blog because we're both aligned in how we approach the world.  We're both heavily focused on outcomes and challenging conventional notions of how to produce those outcomes.  Cal's written four books: [How to Be a High School Superstar: A Revolutionary Plan to Get into College by Standing Out Without Burning Out)](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767932587?ie=UTF8&tag=stuhac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0767932587), [How to Win at College: Surprising Secrets for Success from the Country's Top Students](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767917871?ie=UTF8&tag=stuhac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0767917871),[How to Become a Straight-A Student: The Unconventional Strategies Real College Students Use to Score High While Studying Less](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0767922719?ie=UTF8&tag=stuhac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0767922719), [So Good They Can't Ignore You: Why Skills Trump Passion in the Quest for Work You Love](http://www.amazon.com/Good-They-Cant-Ignore-ebook/dp/B0076DDBJ6/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1374148150&sr=1-1&keywords=so+good+they+can%27t+ignore+you).  As soon as I saw the titles of the books I knew we were kindred spirits (before I realized we were fellow alumni).  When I was in high school, I hated school, and found most of my classes and teachers and absolute waste of time.  I spent most of my time reading fiction books during my classes, copying homework in the mornings, and memorizing everything I needed to know during the lunch period preceding any tests.  I didn't feel like the traditional model of education worked, but as a teenager I had little choice but to play the game I was forced to play.  However, I wanted to make sure that I gamed the system to the maximum allowable degree.  I would carefully plan out how I could achieve the highest GPA with the least amount of effort.  An 89.5 in an honors class would give me a 4.5 towards my GPA and a 79.5 would give me a 3.5.  I took all the honors/AP classes possible and would decide which were the two easiest to get A's in order to keep my 3.7 GPA which was about what I figured I'd need to get into a good college. As all students do I gamed the college admissions process by joining absurd clubs, starting clubs, etc etc. while of course also listing my real interests like sports and music.
So when I came across Cal's blog I realized that we both approached life in the same way.  What are the rules of the game.  What outcome would I like out of this game.  How can I get that outcome without having to do what most people perceive as the ONLY way to achieve those results.  Usually by applying the 80/20 principle in as many places as possible you can achieve remarkable results with very little of the negatives dictated by the rules of any game.  

In the game of life, following your passion is unlikely to lead to what most people want.  Tony Hshieh has made an art out of figuing out what people really want and giving it to them.  The success of Zappos has proven that he knows what both his customers and his employees want.  In his book he says "
Happiness is really just about four things: perceived control, perceived progress, connectedness (number and depth of your relationships), and vision/meaning (being part of something bigger than yourself)."  
In Cal's latest book he notes "In 2002, a research team led by the Canadian psychologist Robert J. Vallerand administered an extensive questionnaire to a group of 539 Canadian university students. The questionnaire’s prompts were designed to answer two important questions: Do these students have passions? And if so, what are they?
At the core of the passion hypothesis is the assumption that we all have pre-existing passions waiting to be discovered. This experiment puts that assumption to the test. Here’s what it found: 84 percent of the students surveyed were identified as having a passion. This sounds like good news for the supporters of the passion hypothesis — that is, until you dive deeper into the details of these pursuits. Here are the top five identified passions: dance, hockey, (these were Canadian students, mind you), skiing, reading, and swimming. Though dear to the heart of the students, these passions don’t have much to offer when it comes to choosing a job. In fact, less than 4 percent of the total identified passions had any relation to work or education, with the remaining 96 percent describing hobby-style interests such as sports and art.

So how DO we succeed?  You need to BECOME good at something. 

Cal's advice is to abandon the passion mindset which asks “What does this job offer me? Am I happy with this job? Is it giving me everything I want?” Shift from that mindset to…“What am I offering the world? How valuable am I? Am I really not that valuable? If I’m not that valuable, then I shouldn’t expect things in my working life. How can I get better?”

Once I realized this, my whole paradigm shifted.  Rather than expecting fulfillment to be given to me by some external source, a job that magically fulfilled my passion, suddenly I had some agency.  I was in charge of becoming passionate about something.

How do you find "your passion".  Your passion is really just something you're good at.
Cal explains that "Long-term career satisfaction requires traits like a real sense of autonomy, a real sense of impact on the world, a sense of mastery that you’re good at what you do, and a sense of connection in relation to other people.
Now, the key point is those traits are not matched to a specific piece of work and they have nothing to do with matching your job to some sort of ingrained, pre-existing passion.

Rule #1: Don’t Follow Your Passion. Here I make my argument that “follow your passion” is bad advice. You’ve heard me talk about this on Study Hacks, but in this chapter, I lay out my full-throated, comprehensive, detailed argument against this common advice.
Rule #2: Be So Good They Can’t Ignore You. Here I detail the philosophy that works better than following your passion. This philosophy, which I call career capital theory, says that you first build up rare and valuable skills and then use these skills as leverage to shape you career into something you love. During this chapter I spend time with a professional guitar player, television writer, and venture capitalist, among others, in my quest to understand how people get really good at what they do. You’ll also encounter a detailed discussion of deliberate practice and how to apply it in your working life.
Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion. Here I argue that control is one of the most important things you can bargain for with your rare and valuable skills. I discuss the difficulties people face in trying to move toward more autonomy in their working lives and describe strategies that can help you sidestep these pitfalls. During this chapter, I spend time with a hotshot database developer, an entrepreneurial medical resident, an Ivy League-trained organic farmer, and Derek Sivers, among others, in my attempts to decode control.
Rule #4: Think Small, Act Big. In this final rule, I explore how people end up with career-defining missions — often a source of great passion. I argue that you need rare and valuable skills before you can identify a powerful mission. I then spend time with a star Harvard professor, a television host, and a Ruby on Rails guru, all in an effort to identify best practices for cultivating this trait.

Michael Ellsberg's book
[The Education of Millionaires: Everything You Won't Learn in College About How to Be Successful](http://www.amazon.com/books/dp/1591845610)
He talks about developing practical success skills in the real world: how to find great mentors, build a world-class network, make your work meaningful (and your meaning work), build the brand of you, and more. Learning these skills is a necessary addition to any education, whether you’re a high school dropout or graduate of Harvard Law School.


Robert Greene, who I first heard interviewed on Mixergy wrote about [Mastery](http://www.amazon.com/Mastery-ebook/dp/B007V65PBK/)


Tim Ferris challenged the notion of "success".  Rather than the deferred life dream of hapiness coming at retirement and success being making a lot of money by working all the time, he refined the definition of success to be having enough time to do the things you enjoy doing at substantially reduced cost.  He totally has bailed on the idea of work being where you find joy.

You don't need "courage" to follow your passion.  Any idiot can quit their job, and many have.

create more value than you capture, look at life as value creation rather than how happy your job is making you

things cal's missing
exposure.  how did that guy know he wanted to be a screenwriter?  people won't work on stuff that they're not interested in.  there's something in between following your passion and working hard on something that is interesting.  for example i spent two years head down working on ruby because i loved it.  if you asked me to spend that much time studying literature there's no amount of prodding that would have allowed me to do it
