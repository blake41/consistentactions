This post is an homage to Geoff Vitt who has been inspiring me with his I'm lovin posts. It was also inspired by another fantastic TED talk (http://escapethecity.org/resources/766-shawn-achor-the-happy-secret-to-better-work).

So here's my list of things I'm lovin:



	
  * The NYC Tech Community

	
  * Rails/Ruby mentors - Dan/Dave/Snuggs/Avi/John Nunemaker

	
  * Meetup.com - Probably one of the biggest drivers of positive change in my life.

	
  * Ruby

	
  * Waking up every morning and being excited to go to work.  Living to program/Dreaming in code.

	
  * Limitless possibilities

	
  * Endlessly working to push myself forward, but at the same time being happy where I am.  Having enough (maybe except time)

	
  * The internet and the rise of essentially limitless information coupled with strong communities on the net.  In about 3 months of 60-80 hour weeks coding, I went from 0 to full time employed programmer.  Through stackoverflow, blogs, railsguides, the pragmatic programmers books and leaning on some Ruby Nuby friends and a lot of blood sweat and tears I was able to teach myself to Ruby.  I can't imagine there was ever a point in human history when one could self educate in such a way.  Truly a phenomenal time and place we live in.

	
  * Stackoverflow (the first place I go for just about every question)

	
  * Open source (where do I begin?)

	
  * Github (democratizing the world through software)

	
  * OS X (having the terminal baked into the OS is awesome)

	
  * My Iphone (just joined the cult a few months ago)

	
  * My magic mouse, macbook pro, and two 24 inch beasts in my home office.

	
  * Watching Emma realize that all her limitations are self imposed.

	
  * The ability to surprise and reinvent myself.

	
  * Working hard for the first time in my life.  Seeing what's possible when I don't quit.  Starting to tap my potential for the first time.

	
  * Taking the long view for the first time in my life.  Hat tip ceonyc http://www.thisisgoingtobebig.com/blog/2011/12/5/reverse-engineering-a-career.html
