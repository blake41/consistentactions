I've been doing a lot of self improvement reading, in my attempt to give my life direction in the post travel era.

If you don't like self-help or business books, skip this post. However, if you are open to the possibility of growth through reading and altering your behavior, these books all have the power to change your life. (In no particular order)

1. The Art of Non-Conformity - Chris Guillebeau
2. Unlimited Power - Tony Robbins (Go ahead, roll your eyes Byran, and then get over yourself and read it)
3. Influence - Robert Cialdini
4. Linchpin - Seth Godin
5. Ignore Everybody - Hugh MacLeod
6. How to Win Friends and Influence People
7. Rework

In a separate category of good, but not necessarily epic
1. Never Eat Alone - Keith Ferazzi
2. The 4 Hour WW - Tim Ferris
