From Dilbert...

So here's your humor toolbox:

1.       Pick a topic that is current.

2.       Put something in the wrong context.

3.       Make someone in the scenario a loser.

4.       Add familiar and mundane elements to ground the joke.

5.       Create a solution or logic that almost makes sense but doesn't.

6.       Use sarcasm and exaggeration if necessary.
