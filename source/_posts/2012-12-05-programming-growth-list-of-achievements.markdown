I've been looking for a roadmap of how to become a better developer for a long time.  This is the first thing I've come across that gets at what I'm looking for.

Copied from http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2011/08/09/programming-achievements-how-to-level-up-as-a-developer/



	
  1. Identify the experiences that advance a person as a developer.

	
  2. Select a particular experience to pursue.

	
  3. Pursue that experience to completion. (Achievement unlocked!)

	
  4. Reflect on that experience. Really soak it in. [A]

	
  5. Return to Step 2, this time selecting a new experience.


**Learn a variety of [programming paradigms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm):**



	
  * Write a program in assembly language

	
  * Write an application in a functional language

	
  * Write an application in an object-oriented language

	
  * Write an application in a prototype-based language

	
  * Write an application in a logic programming language

	
  * Write an application using the Actor model

	
  * Write an application in Forth [C]


**Experience the ins and outs of programming for different platforms:**



	
  * Write a nontrivial web app

	
  * Write a nontrivial desktop app

	
  * Write a nontrivial mobile app

	
  * Write an embedded app

	
  * Write a realtime system


**Enhance your understanding of the building blocks that we use as developers:**



	
  * Write a networking client (e.g., HTTP, FTP)

	
  * Write a device driver

	
  * Write a B-tree database

	
  * Wrap an existing library to provide a better (more pleasant) user experience

	
  * Write an application or framework that provides a plugin model

	
  * Write a testing framework

	
  * Write a programming language


**Enlighten yourself with koans, katas, and the wisdom of ages:**



	
  * Complete five [code katas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming))

	
  * Complete the [programming koans](http://sett.ociweb.com/sett/settJan2011.html) for a language that you want to learn

	
  * Attend a [code retreat](http://coderetreat.com/)

	
  * Read [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) and complete all the exercises


**Program in the open:**



	
  * Contribute to an open source project

	
  * Have a patch accepted

	
  * Earn commit rights on a significant open source project

	
  * Publish an open source project

	
  * Perform a [Refactotum](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2007/04/03/twir.html) of an open source project


**Learn by teaching others [D]:**



	
  * Present a lightning talk

	
  * Present at a local user group

	
  * Present at a conference

	
  * Deliver a training course

	
  * Publish a tutorial

	
  * Publish a constructive code review of an open source project

	
  * Write a programming book




## About the Achievements


Now, let's go meta for a moment. Note that each of these achievements is measurable. Each one is Boolean: you've either completed it or you haven't. For example, it's hard to measure whether you've learned a functional language, but it's easy to know whether you've written an app in a functional language. The latter is observable. Measurable. Boolean. This measurability applies, quite intentionally, to all of these achievements.

Admittedly, the measurability isn't perfect. Consider the achievement of presenting at a conference: you could certainly do a half-assed job just to say you've earned this achievement. But if you're reading this post, I assume you want to be excellent. You know that it's lame to phone it in just to cross an item off the list.


## Since We're Talking About Improvement ...


Since we're talking about improvement, what would you change about this list?

The list is available as a [gist](https://gist.github.com/1133830#file_programming_achievements.md) on GitHub. Feel free to fork it and add more achievements. (Make sure they're measurable.)

Or, fork it and mark off the achievements you've already conquered. You might even flag the one that you're currently working on. (For example, check out these forks from [Justin Blake](https://gist.github.com/1134309), [Pierre Chapuis](https://gist.github.com/1134276), and [Yann Esposito](https://gist.github.com/1134044).)

Or just sound off in the comments: What experiences have made you a better developer? And what achievement will you unlock next?
